        <h4>Week 1</h4>
        <p>I had 0 prior experience with any coding before this and came in with some design background, so I was defenitely overwhelmed to begin with. I remember I found simply pushing things to github being my main difficulty. Our tool kit was pretty small to begin with, so I was able to keep up. However, getting used to github was the first main challenge I remember facing. </p>

        <h4>Week 2</h4>
        <p>This was the first time we began using flexbox for layout. In this screenshot, I was excited about learning about adding a scroll feature with css when the text overflowed. I also began doing some research and adding in my soruces into my code as notes which became helpful.</p>

        <h4>Week 3/4</h4>
        <p>I began understanding responsive design — buttons, links, clicks, hovers, etc. I got to experiment with more styling which I liked as well. The projects began to give me more creative freedome. However, the ability to do so much was overwhelming at first...it becamse exciting later though!</p>

        <h4>Week 5/6</h4>
        <p>Java script made little to no sense to me at frist I will not lie. In week 5, I struggled with fitting the text into the frames which were just images I placed text over. As you can see in my code for week 6, it consisted of very simple interactions of pressing a button and switching images. However, to me that was more than I knew how to do before! I also liked being able to carry over and continue playing with the styling.</p>

        <h4>Pair Programming</h4>
        <p>Coordinating code with someone else was defenitely a learning experience. Because there are just so many different ways to do something and everyone has different experiences and workflows, pair programming took a lot more effort. However, this was a very fun project and I learned and was inspired by all the net art we got to research and also hear about from other groups.</p>

        <h4>Week 10/11</h4>
        <p>During week 10, when you pressed the button, the messages showed below the main screen. In week 11, I was able to implement some js that allowed the initial screen to be hidden ocne you interacted with the button. .</p>
