         <p>This reading was very interesting to read knowing it was written in 1945 — so many of Bush’s predcitions alluded to many innovations that we use today such as personal computers, search engines, and even the hardrive. It is really intersting to see how “optimistic” Bush’s perspective of technolgoy is at this point in time. I agree, in that technolgoy has the potential to boost efficienty and supprt communcation, productivity, and innovation. However, I would be very intereted to hear what Bush has to say about AI. Does this support or go against what Bush was envisioning? There are definitely both pros and cons, and based on this readed Bush does seem “pro” AI. However, I don’t think this reading acknowledges that sacrifices or negative impacts that such advanced technology can have on a society..just something to think about/sparked my interest when reading.</p>
